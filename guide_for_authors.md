# Guide for authors

This documentation is hosted on GitHub ([https://github.com/spm/spm-docs](https://github.com/spm/spm-docs)). When changes are made, these are automatically picked up by GitBook ([https://www.gitbook.com/book/spm/docs/](https://www.gitbook.com/book/spm/docs/)) and published online in HTML and / or PDF format.

### Editing
 SPM authors can add to or change the SPM documentation through two different routes - by changing files directly in the GitHub repository, or by using GitBook's WYSIWYG editor.  
 To use the GitHub option, install the version control software Git on your computer and get a copy of (clone) the spm-docs repository. Windows or Mac users can use the nice [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) software. Any changes pushed to the repository will be updated online automatically.
 Alternatively, developers registered with GitBook can use the online WYSIWYG editor. At the moment we only have a few licenses for this, so option 1 is generally preferred.

### File formats
 All pages in the documentation are written in a simple format called [Markdown](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/syntax/markdown.html), with files ending in .md. Files are organised into folders which represent chapters and sub-chapters.
