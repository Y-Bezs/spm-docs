# Guide for authors

This documentation is hosted on GitHub ([https://github.com/spm/spm-docs](https://github.com/spm/spm-docs)). When changes are made, these are automatically picked up by GitBook ([https://www.gitbook.com/book/spm/docs/](https://www.gitbook.com/book/spm/docs/)) and published online in HTML and / or PDF format.

### Editing
 SPM authors can add to or change the SPM documentation through two different routes - by changing files directly in the GitHub repository, or by using GitBook's WYSIWYG editor.  
 
 To use the GitHub option, install the version control software Git on your computer and get a copy of (clone) the spm-docs repository. Windows or Mac users can use the nice [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) software. Any changes pushed to the repository will be appear online automatically within minutes.
 
 Alternatively, SPM developers can register with [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) and then be added as authors on the documentation. Having done that, an [online WYSIWYG editor](https://www.gitbook.com/book/spm/docs/edit) is available. At the moment we only have a few licenses for this, so it may not be available to all developers.

### File structure
 All pages in the documentation are written in a simple format called [Markdown](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/syntax/markdown.html), with files ending in .md. Files are organised into folders which represent chapters and sub-chapters. The table of contents which links together all the individual chapters and pages is called SUMMARY.md and is stored in the root of the repository. Documentation on how this should be formed can be found [here](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/pages.html).
