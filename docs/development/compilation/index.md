# Compilation of SPM MEX files

Pre-compiled MEX files are provided with the SPM distribution so you shouldn't need to compile the MEX files yourself. We still provide here platform-specific instructions to compile all the MEX files for your machine.

* [Windows](windows.md)
* [Linux](linux.md)
* [macOS](macos.md)

## Troubleshooting

!!! failure "`bad image handle dimensions` error"

    The error "`bad image handle dimensions`" when trying to display an image is an indication that the MEX files are not compatible with your platform and should be recompiled.
