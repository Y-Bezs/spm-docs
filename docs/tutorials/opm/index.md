# OPM 

An optically pumped magnetometer is a type of MEG sensor that does not require cryogenic cooling. They are often sufficiently lightweight to be worn in a helmet. As the sensors are worn, typical processing pipelines used for normal MEG analysis may not be appropriate. As such, the tutorials below aim to explore areas of processing that may be slightly different.
