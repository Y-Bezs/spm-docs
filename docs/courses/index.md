# SPM Courses
We are delighted to welcome visitors to our SPM courses in May and October each year. They are taught by an international faculty of SPM developers and collaborators, either online or in-person at the Functional Imaging Laboratory (FIL) in London. The courses form part of the [UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology's short course programme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/education).

## About
Since 2010, we have provided two separate SPM courses reflecting the different imaging modalities. There is a four-day course on [SPM for EEG/MEG](./eeg_meg/index.md) followed by the long-established three-day course on [SPM for fMRI/VBM](./fmri_vbm/index.md). Both courses are suitable for beginners and more advanced users. We advise students to gain at least some minimal familiarity with the methodology, for example, from reading introductory articles available from the SPM webpage or by following data analysis examples in the [SPM tutorials](../tutorials/index.md).

Read more about the [SPM for M/EEG course](./eeg_meg/index.md) or the [SPM for fMRI & VBM course](./fmri_vbm/index.md).

## Previous recordings
The SPM courses consist of interactive workshops and lectures. To view videos recordings of the lectures from a previous fMRI & VBM course, please select topics from the menu.
