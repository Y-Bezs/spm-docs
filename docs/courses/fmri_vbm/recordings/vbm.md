# Voxel-based morphometry

In this talk, [Dr Christian Lambert](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/11034-christian-lambert) focuses on the concept of structural brain analysis and explores the use of VBM and its implementation in SPM. The talk covers preprocessing fundamentals, common pitfalls, and hints for effective data analysis. Additionally, the extensions to the VBM framework, including longitudinal analysis and voxel-based quantification, are explored.
