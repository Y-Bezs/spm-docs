# Random field theory 

In this talk, [Prof Tom Nichols](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/t-e-nichols) describes how random field theory can be used to help determine the presence of real effects amidst statistical noise in neuroimaging data. The talk outlines various approaches to correcting for multiple comparisons, including family-wise error correction, false discovery rate correction, and permutation testing.
