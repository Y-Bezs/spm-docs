# Bayesian inference

In this talk, [Prof Chris Mathys](https://chrismathys.com/) explores the fundamentals of Bayesian inference and how it helps us extract meaningful insights from data. Whether you're new to the concept or already familiar, the talk covers the key aspects of this mathematical framework for logical reasoning about uncertain quantities, particularly in the analysis of neuroimaging data.
