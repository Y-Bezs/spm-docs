# SPM Course - fMRI & VBM - 14th-16th October 2024

!!! info "Overview"

    This is the programme of the 2025 online [SPM course for fMRI and VBM](./index.md). The course consists of lectures and practical workshops where you will be guided through analyses of different neuroimaging datasets. 
    
    The course covers:

    * Experimental design

    * Preprocessing neuroimaging data
    
    * Quantifying structural changes in the brain (Voxel-Based Morphometry, VBM)

    * Quantifying brain function (using the General Linear Model, GLM)
    
    * Statistics for neuroimaging (frequentist and Bayesian)
    
    * Connectivity analysis (Dynamic Causal Modelling, DCM)

## Course programme

All times are local **London** (United Kingdom) time (**BST**).

The course will take place on **Zoom**. We will send you an email with instructions on how to join in (or see below). 

Each lecture will be streamed at the indicated time. Recordings are also available on-demand through the links in the programme below.

Each lecture will be followed by some **time for questions** from the audience and a **short break** before the next lecture.

Questions can be asked at any time during the lectures using [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/spmcoursefmri-put5820/shared_invite/zt-2sdquk69e-o9yanUUmytwbmvshZpPBxQ) or the Q&A window within Zoom: we will aim at answering them at the end of each lecture or during one of the Q&A sessions.
