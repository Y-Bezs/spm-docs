# DCM Models
 The DCM framework includes a variety of models which can used to explain how brain activity gives rise to neuroimaging timeseries. The models vary in their complexity and biological detail. The choice of which to use comes down to the questions you wish to address, as well as the available data - for instance, MEG can generally support richer models with more free parameters than fMRI data can.
