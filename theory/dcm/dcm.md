# DCM

Dynamic Causal Modelling \(DCM\) is a framework for specifying, estimating and comparing models of neuroimaging data. It is particularly used for studying effective connectivity - the causal influences between brain regions. 

A DCM analysis generally consists of several steps:

##### Model specification

The forward or generative model is a mathematical description of how brain activity or circuitry changes over time, and how it gives rise to the signals measured using imaging devices \(e.g. fMRI, MEG, EEG\). 



It is generally split into two parts: the neuronal model and observation model.
